The Eindhoven University of Technology is one of the major frontrunners in Dutch
(and even worldwide) technical education and research. By closely collaborating
with partners in public and private setting, research is converted to meaningful
solutions. Two of the most important cornerstones of the TU/e, enabling students
to develop themselves optimally and advancing technology for the benefit of society,
are perfectly captured within student teams and thereby Aero. Both founding teams
of Aero, Bluejay and Syfly, were founded by TU/e students, and were greatly
supported by the TU/e since their establishment. Similarly, Aero is given continued
support by the TU/e, both in terms of resources like funding and housing, and
knowledge in the form of guidance and trainings. This way, the TU/e supports its
students within Aero to achieve the unimaginable.
